## Hello there 👋

My name is Alexey, and I love computer science

I'm experienced Python and Golang developer

You can see my **stars** section to find something useful for new ideas 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Golang Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really love learning foreign languages. Currently I'm learning Chinease and trying to reach HSK2 level using book **Intensive Chinese Language Course - 100 Days**.  
One year ago I was learning Deutsch using Duolingo, so I know some words, but I can't really build valuable sentences.  
My native language is Russian

- 💬 Ask me about anything
