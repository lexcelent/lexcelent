## Hi there 👋

My name is Alexey, I love to code, and currently I'm interested in Microservices Architecture

I have 3 years of experience as Python Developer, making some small services and tests with FastAPI and pytest modules.
Now I am learning Go (already 1 year) and I'm looking for a job as Golang Backend Developer.

In free time I like to learn more about Computer Science, Best Practices for some particular tasks, Patterns and sometimes Algorithms...  
I also like to play games and learn how some game mechanics work

Currently in my repos you will find mostly my practice with technologies. And you can see my **stars** section to find something useful for new ideas 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Python Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really love learning foreign languages. Currently I'm learning Chinease and trying to reach HSK1 level using book **Intensive Chinese Language Course - 100 Days**.  
One year ago I was learning Deutsch using Duolingo - so I know some words, but can't really build valuable sentences.  
My native language is Russian
